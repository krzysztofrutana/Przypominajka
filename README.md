    My first android application and my first Java program.
The application allows you to add events for a specific day of the month (if the 31st day of the month is specified, 
the application automatically sets the last days of the month), cyclically every few days, weeks or months, or once on a selected date. 
The whole is displayed in the form of an original calendar with color markings of a given event (which is selected at the stage of adding an event).

The main window displays the author's calendar and a list of events for a specific day or by clicking on a date for a selected day. When you click on an event, detailed information about it is displayed.

When adding a new event, it is required to enter its name and color (it is displayed in the calendar view). Description is optional. 
An event may be cyclical on a given day of the month for a given number of months (e.g. useful when paying bills). 
It can also be cyclical every few days / weeks / months (to be agreed) and apply all the time or repeat only a specified number of times 
(useful in the case of activities, e.g. performed every two days or e.g. taking medications). It is also possible to schedule a one-time event. 
Finally, the start date of the event is given.
